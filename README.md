# Kale College Landing Page

## About
This is a small school project that is supposed to be a clone of the Yale University landing page. Instead of Yale, it is Kale college. There is not much to it other than that.

## Tools
This project uses tailwindcss and HTML.

## Current state
As of right now (7/25/2024), the site is not in a state worthy to present. During the next pushes, this site will truly incorporate tailwindcss to replace the CSS used in the original index.html
There are a lot of coding mistakes and not good practice used. The state of the site is as it was made a few years ago when I did not have as much knowledge of web development.
